Welcome to the Mozilla Clubs Design Resources Repo. Here you can:

  1. Find design resources created by community members which you can use, remix and share.
  2. Share design resources for other club leaders to use.
  3. File issues with your design requests for the community design group, find collaborators, or find design tasks to tackle.
  
Don't forget to use the issue template below to make sure you are including all the relevant information!

Anyone can take (or make) a design issue, as long as it is related to Mozilla Clubs!
