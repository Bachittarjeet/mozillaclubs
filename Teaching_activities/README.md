# Teaching activities and games
In this folder you can add and find acivities and games to teach the web in your Mozilla Club. 

## What kind of activities do we encourage?
At Mozilla Clubs we see teaching and learning happen in many forms like mentoring, peer assisting and collaboration. Club leaders are challenged to meet learners where they are at through curriculum, activities and gatherings. They should welcome all questions, encourage risk-taking, and understand the value of mistakes and failures as powerful learning moments. Being a learner is at the core of being a good facilitator and we encourage everyone to try new things, keep an open mind and take risks!

### Learner centered
The learner-centered approach shifts the focus from the teacher to the student, in a quest to develop learner's autonomy and independence. Your mission as a facilitator in a Mozilla Club event is to motivate, engage and help learners to connect their interests with opportunities in the digital world brings. Your role should be seen as a coach rather than an instructor. Instead of providing a lecture, you will share your knowledge in a way that inspires others to create, make, hack and tweak. 

### Hands on
Mozilla Clubs sessions must be highly interactive events where participants can learn something new or engage in some hands-on making or experimentation. We don’t think the Web should be taught traditionally, with textbooks and a blackboard. The “sage on the stage” approach is directly oppositional to the distributed and participatory nature of the Web we champion. Instead, learners should start by doing what they eventually intend to master: building apps, remixing content, creating web pages, and more.

### Participatory and inclusive
In Mozilla Clubs, we're thoughtful about our learners and respectful of differences. We aim to understand their motivations, needs, and challenges in order to create a learning experience that works well for them. 

### Fun and engaging
Mozilla Clubs are expected to be open, playful, and fun for those attending and teaching. Instead of relying on conventional learning methods that include watching & listening, we encourage facilitators to use engaging, inclusive and fun ways for sharing knowledge.
