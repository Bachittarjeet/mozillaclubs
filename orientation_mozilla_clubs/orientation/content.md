Thanks for joining the Mozilla Clubs community! These training modules are designed to provide you with the skills and knowledge you need in order to run a Mozilla Club in your local community. At the end of the training process you will learn about key issues, resources and opportunities related to Internet Health, The Mozilla Network and The Web Literacy Map. 

**Guidelines for Training**

- **The training is online and humanly supported.** In addition to this online platform, there is an instructor available through email to help you through your learning progress.

- **Contribute ideas and engage with your peers.** The content in the training modules are articulated with online forums and hands-on activities that empower you to create, remix, interact and share.

- **Set your own pace.** You have 2 months to complete the course and it takes an average of 7 hours total. Please note that the training must be finished before you host or participate in a Mozilla Club, as these lessons are critical to running a successful event.

- **Complete the mandatory activities and quizzes.** Each module has a series of activities and quizzes that are required in order to complete the course. They are designed to give you a chance to reflect on what you learn and explore tools we have available for you to use in your club.

Mozilla is a global community of technologists, thinkers and builders working together to keep the Internet alive and accessible, so people worldwide can be informed contributors and creators of the Web.

A. Learn about Mozilla's story

In the late 90's, the Web faced threats of being controlled by a single integrated centralized organization: Microsoft. The web browser became part of Windows and it looked like the Internet was quickly developing into a group of products: Windows, Internet Explorer, Office, servers, file formats, and protocols. It became clear that an alternative browser was needed that would put the end user first. Which is how Firefox emerged â€” to shift the trajectory of the Internet.
