# A. Learn about Mozilla's story

In the late 90's, the Web faced threats of being controlled by a single integrated centralized organization: Microsoft. The web browser became part of Windows and it looked like the Internet was quickly developing into a group of products: Windows, Internet Explorer, Office, servers, file formats, and protocols. It became clear that an alternative browser was needed that would put the end user first. Which is how Firefox emerged — to shift the trajectory of the Internet. 

**A shift in history**

The Mozilla project was [created in 1998](https://air.mozilla.org/code-rush/) with the release of the [Netscape browser](http://web.archive.org/web/20021001071727/wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html) suite source code. It was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market. Within the [first year](http://www-archive.mozilla.org/mozilla-at-one.html), new community members from around the world had already contributed new functionality, enhanced existing features and became engaged in the management and planning of the project itself.

In this blog post Mitchell Baker, Executive Chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation and of Mozilla Corporation, describes how, at that time, what we were trying to do seemed impossible. It took six years to create a fully formed, polished consumer product called Firefox. Consumers and industry experts quickly realized how much potential it had.

Tens of millions of people installed the browser in no time. Mozilla and Firefox made an impact and helped spark a wave of thinking about “open” in modern life — open data, open government, open science, citizen journalism, open architecture, etc.

[Photo used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozfest/albums/72157658649418943/page4)

The Internet is an integral part of modern life and affects our lives in many ways. Billions of people depend on the Internet for knowledge, livelihood, self-expression and more. This is why it is a global public resource, and this is why it must remain open and accessible to all.

The Mozilla Manifesto synthesizes [10 principles](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) that articulate a vision for the Internet in which we are all equal.

An Internet that enriches the lives of individual human beings by giving them the tools to shape their own experiences. An Internet that ensures privacy and security. An Internet where participation is possible through transparent community-based processes. An Internet that balances commercial profit and public benefit. 

 It is key that all club leaders incorporate these principles, and a code of conduct into their practices, when:

* Working in Mozilla spaces.
* Working with other community participants virtually or co-located.
* Representing Mozilla at public events.
* Representing Mozilla in social media (official accounts, staff accounts, personal accounts, Facebook pages).
* Participating in Mozilla offsites and trainings.
* Participating in Mozilla-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or person-to-person  meetings, and Mozilla-related correspondence.

# C. Read and Reflect on Mozilla's mission

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/BXVZxXE.jpg)
[Photo: "And then there were five" - Mozilla Open Design used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NN-save-the-internet.jpg)

*“Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent."*

Our mission goes beyond building successful products. It is about working close together with people, fueling a worldwide movement to keep the Internet healthy, open and accessible to all. In addition to Firefox we have developed tools and diverse programs from education to advocacy, to accomplish this mission.

**There are multiple ways to get involved:**

* [Contribute](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/), learn, collaborate and share your skills with a global community of Mozillians — coders, organizers, activists and more —. Your [contribution](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/signup/) can start with something simple like using Firefox in your smartphone, or something a bit more challenging like finding, reporting and/or fixing errors via Bugzilla.

* [Connect](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/communities/) with other Mozillians in your area to see what's going on with Mozilla near you. Find a site in your language (or start your own), see upcoming events and learn about other contribution opportunities.

* [Get involved](https://network.mofoprod.net/get-involved/) in new projects like fellowship opportunities, events, trainings, research projects, and more!

* [Help to shape](https://network.mofoprod.net/projects/) a Healthy Internet by working on projects related to Open Innovation, Digital Inclusion, Decentralization, Privacy/Security and Web Literacy.

### LESSON 2. Fueling the movement of the Open Web
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/sJAWGkG.jpg)
[Photo Mozfest2015 by Mozfest used under CC BY by Mozilla Clubs.](https://2015.mozillafestival.org/)

*"Mozilla was born from the free and open source software movement. And, as a part of this larger movement, Mozilla helped make "open" mainstream. We toppled a monopoly, got the web back on an open track, and put open source software into the hands of hundreds of millions of people. It’s time for us to do this again: Fuel the movement to drive the next wave of open."

### A. The open web at risk

"Many of the principles we associate with the Web — openness, decentralization and the ability for anyone to publish without asking permission from others — are endangered.

It feels like the ability to act without permission on the Web is slipping away into “mobile” or “social” or “big data.” Your choice of device, products or programs will determine much of your online experiences — the software and content available to you, what payment systems you can use, where your data goes, which, if any, of your data you can manage, the way you identify yourself to the world. People and businesses are able to innovate within the framework determined by larger businesses. One can only act as you’re given permission.

This is a threat. And it isn’t very different from the version of the Internet that was emerging years ago. The possibilities of mobile, social and big data are astonishing. But the current implementation drives all of us into a world of monitoring, control and opportunities determined by others . We don’t want to be owned and tracked by giant multinationals or governments, or told what of the Web we are allowed to enjoy. This is not the trajectory that we think the Internet should be on.

Of course, changing this trajectory feels impossible to most people —just as it did years ago. But we believe we can have great technology, exciting products, great user experiences, new innovation, and freedom. That’s why Mozilla is here. And it is why we need people to help us accomplish our mission."

### B. Introduction to the Open Leadership Training 101 

Open leadership and working open are powerful tools to use as we work together keep our Internet— a dynamic, complex, interconnected ecosystem of people, ideas, information—healthy and open.

At Mozilla and across the Mozilla Network, we’re protecting and promoting Internet health in five key areas: Open Innovation, Digital Inclusion, Decentralization, Privacy and Security, and Web Literacy. Details about each are provided below.

Upon completion of this training we suggest that you take our [Open Leadership 101 training](http://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101/), to get more experience with working open, learn about open methods, platforms and tools, and get inspired by successful projects which have appropriated this philosophy. 


### LESSON 3. Why Internet Health Matters
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qvbQnlD.jpg)
[Photo used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla.](https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/mozorg/internet-health/hub/hero-image.2872f0fef89b.jpg)

"The Internet is an ecosystem. A living entity that billions of people depend on for knowledge, livelihood, self-expression, love…. The health of this system relies on – and influences – everyone it touches. This is why we want to diagnose what’s helping and what’s hurting it." [Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/about/)

> **Outline**

> A. What does the Internet Health mean?
> B. Internet Health Report
> C. Five health markers 

### A. What does Internet Health mean?

The internet was designed as tool for public use. It is a place where anyone can publish or make, without asking permission. The internet has grown as a platform for our collective creativity, collaboration and self expression.

We believe that In order to continue this, it needs to remain open and decentralized. With growing monopolies like Facebook and Google, and ongoing hacker threats we can’t help but wonder if this public resource can remain safe and dependable?

At Mozilla, when we talk about Internet Health we refer to the state of our largest global resource in five key areas: decentralization, open innovation, online privacy and security, digital inclusion and web literacy . How do we measure it? How do we monitor and assess the health of the Internet?What tools do we use for a diagnosis?

### B. The Internet Health Report

“Use your imagination to visualize what’s coming: we are increasingly surrounded by connected devices meant to ‘help’ with every aspect of our lives — eating, walking, driving, growing food, finding a parking spot, having sex, building a widget, having a baby (or not), running a city. This so-called Internet of Things [will include 20.8 billion devices by 2020,](hhttp://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3165317) all collecting and collating data constantly.” [Let’s Talk About Internet Health](https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2017/01/digital-citizens-lets-talk-about-internet-health/)

The Internet is our environment. How it works has a direct impact on our lives, our happiness, our privacy, our economies and democracies.

This is why Mozilla created and released the Internet Health Report. An open-source research project, that aims to start a conversation with the citizens of the Internet, about what is healthy, unhealthy, and what lies ahead for the Internet.

We’re hoping that you will read it, comment, hack it and share it, to make it better.

### c. Five health markers

Mozilla chooses to focus on the following issues because they all have an influence on the social, technical, political and economic shape of the internet. Deeply intertwined, these issues — and the choices we make around them — have a deep impact on the health of the Internet, for better or for worse.

Mozilla Clubs focus on one or more issues, helping to shape the health of the Internet within local communities. 

* **Open innovation**

“When we use the word “Open” at Mozilla we mean that anyone can publish or invent online without asking for permission, and that the technologies used to run the Web are transparent and understandable.”

**How to promote Open Innovation?**

* [Support Open Source initiatives](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/open-innovation/#opensource)
* [Engage in the copyright reform campaign](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/open-innovation/#copyright)
* [Understand how to influence patent policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/open-innovation/#patents)

Learn about some key findings about Open Innovation from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“The big question now is: will the openness of the Internet last or wither? Policy threats in areas like copyright are multiplying.”

*“Intellectual property laws stifle creativity and innovation if they are too restrictive about sharing and remixing – particularly for educational and non-profit use, which would be permitted under “fair use”.

*“In Europe this year, the Web is at mercy of lawmakers who will consider whether linking to news articles without permission should be a copyright infringement.” 

* **Online Privacy and Security**

The safety and security of the Internet impacts us all. We should be able to understand what is happening to our data, and have the ability to control who sees it and how it is used.

**How to promote Online Privacy and Security?**

* [Manage your preferences and applications](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/#control)
* [Choose strong passwords and verification process](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/#security)
* ]Understand surveillance and encryption](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/#surveillance)

Learn about some key findings about Open Innovation from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“Close to a third of the world’s population still have no data protection rights.“ “Just four in 10 (38%) of internet users trust that their activities on the internet are not being monitored.”

*“There is more public scrutiny of surveillance laws than before, but it hasn’t stopped greater snooping powers from being proposed in Britain, Pakistan, France and several other countries.” 

* **Digital inclusion**

For the Internet to fulfill its greatest promise, it must reflect the diversity and experience of all people, everywhere.

**How to practice inclusion?**

* [Promote diversity in online environments](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/digital-inclusion/#diversity)
* [Practice and model respectful exchanges online](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/digital-inclusion/#respect)
* [Support universal access](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/digital-inclusion/#access)

Some key findings about Digital Inclusion from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“Unless policies change fast, only 16% of people in least developed countries will be online by 2020. 58% of people in the world can't afford an Internet connection. 39.5% of the world’s population cannot afford Internet on their phone or mobile device”

*“Chinese is the second biggest language on the Internet in terms of users, but only 2% of Web content is in Chinese.”

*"73% of Internet users have seen someone harassed online and 40% have personally experienced it." 

* **Decentralization*
Decentralization means the Internet is controlled by many. It’s millions of devices linked together in an open network. No one actor should ever own it, control it, or switch it off to anyone.

How to promote decentralization?

* [Speak up for Net Neutrality](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#neutrality)
* [Try using tools that are interoperable](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#interoperability)
* [Be informed about the tools you use online.](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#choice)
* [Contribute new online content](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#local)

Some key findings about Decentralization from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“The Internet and the World Wide Web remain the biggest decentralized communication system humanity has ever seen.”

*“A small handful of companies – including Facebook, Google, Apple, Tencent, AliBaba and Amazon – dominate the global Internet sector. In most EU member countries, Google controls more than 90 percent of the search market. In some countries, it controls as much as 97%”.

*“As of December 2016, 47 countries currently have laws in place to protect Net Neutrality.” 

* **Web literacy **

People everywhere should have the knowledge they need to tap into the full power of the Internet – and use it to make their lives and the world better. This means everyone needs to be able to read, write, and participate online. A healthy Internet is yours to master.

**How to promote Web literacy?**

* [Make online contributions meaningful](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/web-literacy/#meaningful)
* [Teach and mentor others effectively](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/web-literacy/#teaching)
* [Cultivate digital citizenship](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/web-literacy/#citizenship)

Some key findings about Web Literacy from the Report:

*“82% of American middle-schoolers assessed couldn’t tell the difference between an ad labeled “sponsored content” and a real news story on a website. “

*“Most people still don’t really understand how the Internet works at a basic level.”

*“A small-scale survey in five countries showed that many Facebook users either don’t know the app is on the Internet, or have no idea there is an Internet beyond Facebook.” 

**Web Literacy Map**

In 2013, Mozilla, in collaboration with community stakeholders, designed the first [Web Literacy Map](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/) to identify a set of core web literacy skills, and set the stage for engaging individuals as citizens of the web.

To learn more about the competencies and skills included in the most recent version of our Web Literacy map, read this [White paper](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/).
