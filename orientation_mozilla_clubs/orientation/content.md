### A. Learn about Mozilla's story

In the late 90's, the Web faced threats of being controlled by a single integrated centralized organization: Microsoft. The web browser became part of Windows and it looked like the Internet was quickly developing into a group of products: Windows, Internet Explorer, Office, servers, file formats, and protocols. It became clear that an alternative browser was needed that would put the end user first. Which is how Firefox emerged — to shift the trajectory of the Internet. 

**A shift in history**

The Mozilla project was [created in 1998](https://air.mozilla.org/code-rush/) with the release of the [Netscape browser](http://web.archive.org/web/20021001071727/wp.netscape.com/newsref/pr/newsrelease558.html) suite source code. It was intended to harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the Internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market. Within the [first year](http://www-archive.mozilla.org/mozilla-at-one.html), new community members from around the world had already contributed new functionality, enhanced existing features and became engaged in the management and planning of the project itself.

In this blog post Mitchell Baker, Executive Chairwoman of the Mozilla Foundation and of Mozilla Corporation, describes how, at that time, what we were trying to do seemed impossible. It took six years to create a fully formed, polished consumer product called Firefox. Consumers and industry experts quickly realized how much potential it had.

Tens of millions of people installed the browser in no time. Mozilla and Firefox made an impact and helped spark a wave of thinking about “open” in modern life — open data, open government, open science, citizen journalism, open architecture, etc.

[Photo used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozfest/albums/72157658649418943/page4)

The Internet is an integral part of modern life and affects our lives in many ways. Billions of people depend on the Internet for knowledge, livelihood, self-expression and more. This is why it is a global public resource, and this is why it must remain open and accessible to all.

The Mozilla Manifesto synthesizes [10 principles](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) that articulate a vision for the Internet in which we are all equal.

An Internet that enriches the lives of individual human beings by giving them the tools to shape their own experiences. An Internet that ensures privacy and security. An Internet where participation is possible through transparent community-based processes. An Internet that balances commercial profit and public benefit. 

 It is key that all club leaders incorporate these principles, and a code of conduct into their practices, when:

* Working in Mozilla spaces.
* Working with other community participants virtually or co-located.
* Representing Mozilla at public events.
* Representing Mozilla in social media (official accounts, staff accounts, personal accounts, Facebook pages).
* Participating in Mozilla offsites and trainings.
* Participating in Mozilla-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels, bugs, group or person-to-person  meetings, and Mozilla-related correspondence.

### C. Read and Reflect on Mozilla's mission

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/BXVZxXE.jpg)
[Photo: "And then there were five" - Mozilla Open Design used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/NN-save-the-internet.jpg)

*“Our mission is to ensure the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all. An Internet that truly puts people first, where individuals can shape their own experience and are empowered, safe and independent."*

Our mission goes beyond building successful products. It is about working close together with people, fueling a worldwide movement to keep the Internet healthy, open and accessible to all. In addition to Firefox we have developed tools and diverse programs from education to advocacy, to accomplish this mission.

**There are multiple ways to get involved:**

* [Contribute](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/), learn, collaborate and share your skills with a global community of Mozillians — coders, organizers, activists and more —. Your [contribution](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contribute/signup/) can start with something simple like using Firefox in your smartphone, or something a bit more challenging like finding, reporting and/or fixing errors via Bugzilla.

* [Connect](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/communities/) with other Mozillians in your area to see what's going on with Mozilla near you. Find a site in your language (or start your own), see upcoming events and learn about other contribution opportunities.

* [Get involved](https://network.mofoprod.net/get-involved/) in new projects like fellowship opportunities, events, trainings, research projects, and more!

* [Help to shape](https://network.mofoprod.net/projects/) a Healthy Internet by working on projects related to Open Innovation, Digital Inclusion, Decentralization, Privacy/Security and Web Literacy.

# LESSON 2. Fueling the movement of the Open Web
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/sJAWGkG.jpg)
[Photo Mozfest2015 by Mozfest used under CC BY by Mozilla Clubs.](https://2015.mozillafestival.org/)

*"Mozilla was born from the free and open source software movement. And, as a part of this larger movement, Mozilla helped make "open" mainstream. We toppled a monopoly, got the web back on an open track, and put open source software into the hands of hundreds of millions of people. It’s time for us to do this again: Fuel the movement to drive the next wave of open." [Fueling a Movement - Mark Surman, Executive Director of Mozilla Foundation](https://marksurman.commons.ca/2015/10/26/fueling-a-movement/)

> b. Introduction to the Open Leadership Training 101

### A. The open web at risk

"Many of the principles we associate with the Web — openness, decentralization and the ability for anyone to publish without asking permission from others — are endangered.

It feels like the ability to act without permission on the Web is slipping away into “mobile” or “social” or “big data.” Your choice of device, products or programs will determine much of your online experiences — the software and content available to you, what payment systems you can use, where your data goes, which, if any, of your data you can manage, the way you identify yourself to the world. People and businesses are able to innovate within the framework determined by larger businesses. One can only act as you’re given permission.

This is a threat. And it isn’t very different from the version of the Internet that was emerging years ago. The possibilities of mobile, social and big data are astonishing. But the current implementation drives all of us into a world of monitoring, control and opportunities determined by others . We don’t want to be owned and tracked by giant multinationals or governments, or told what of the Web we are allowed to enjoy. This is not the trajectory that we think the Internet should be on.

Of course, changing this trajectory feels impossible to most people —just as it did years ago. But we believe we can have great technology, exciting products, great user experiences, new innovation, and freedom. That’s why Mozilla is here. And it is why we need people to help us accomplish our mission."

### B. Introduction to the Open Leadership Training 101 

Open leadership and working open are powerful tools to use as we work together keep our Internet— a dynamic, complex, interconnected ecosystem of people, ideas, information—healthy and open.

At Mozilla and across the Mozilla Network, we’re protecting and promoting Internet health in five key areas: Open Innovation, Digital Inclusion, Decentralization, Privacy and Security, and Web Literacy. Details about each are provided below.

Upon completion of this training we suggest that you take our [Open Leadership 101 training](http://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101/), to get more experience with working open, learn about open methods, platforms and tools, and get inspired by successful projects which have appropriated this philosophy. 


# LESSON 3. Why Internet Health Matters
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/qvbQnlD.jpg)
[Photo used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla.](https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/mozorg/internet-health/hub/hero-image.2872f0fef89b.jpg)

"The Internet is an ecosystem. A living entity that billions of people depend on for knowledge, livelihood, self-expression, love…. The health of this system relies on – and influences – everyone it touches. This is why we want to diagnose what’s helping and what’s hurting it." [Internet Health Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/about/)

> **Outline**

> A. What does the Internet Health mean?
> B. Internet Health Report
> C. Five health markers 

### A. What does Internet Health mean?

The internet was designed as tool for public use. It is a place where anyone can publish or make, without asking permission. The internet has grown as a platform for our collective creativity, collaboration and self expression.

We believe that In order to continue this, it needs to remain open and decentralized. With growing monopolies like Facebook and Google, and ongoing hacker threats we can’t help but wonder if this public resource can remain safe and dependable?

At Mozilla, when we talk about Internet Health we refer to the state of our largest global resource in five key areas: decentralization, open innovation, online privacy and security, digital inclusion and web literacy . How do we measure it? How do we monitor and assess the health of the Internet?What tools do we use for a diagnosis?

### B. The Internet Health Report

“Use your imagination to visualize what’s coming: we are increasingly surrounded by connected devices meant to ‘help’ with every aspect of our lives — eating, walking, driving, growing food, finding a parking spot, having sex, building a widget, having a baby (or not), running a city. This so-called Internet of Things [will include 20.8 billion devices by 2020,](hhttp://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3165317) all collecting and collating data constantly.” [Let’s Talk About Internet Health](https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2017/01/digital-citizens-lets-talk-about-internet-health/)

The Internet is our environment. How it works has a direct impact on our lives, our happiness, our privacy, our economies and democracies.

This is why Mozilla created and released the Internet Health Report. An open-source research project, that aims to start a conversation with the citizens of the Internet, about what is healthy, unhealthy, and what lies ahead for the Internet.

We’re hoping that you will read it, comment, hack it and share it, to make it better.

### c. Five health markers

Mozilla chooses to focus on the following issues because they all have an influence on the social, technical, political and economic shape of the internet. Deeply intertwined, these issues — and the choices we make around them — have a deep impact on the health of the Internet, for better or for worse.

Mozilla Clubs focus on one or more issues, helping to shape the health of the Internet within local communities. 

* **Open innovation**

“When we use the word “Open” at Mozilla we mean that anyone can publish or invent online without asking for permission, and that the technologies used to run the Web are transparent and understandable.”

**How to promote Open Innovation?**

* [Support Open Source initiatives](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/open-innovation/#opensource)
* [Engage in the copyright reform campaign](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/open-innovation/#copyright)
* [Understand how to influence patent policy](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/open-innovation/#patents)

Learn about some key findings about Open Innovation from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“The big question now is: will the openness of the Internet last or wither? Policy threats in areas like copyright are multiplying.”

*“Intellectual property laws stifle creativity and innovation if they are too restrictive about sharing and remixing – particularly for educational and non-profit use, which would be permitted under “fair use”.

*“In Europe this year, the Web is at mercy of lawmakers who will consider whether linking to news articles without permission should be a copyright infringement.” 

* **Online Privacy and Security**

The safety and security of the Internet impacts us all. We should be able to understand what is happening to our data, and have the ability to control who sees it and how it is used.

**How to promote Online Privacy and Security?**

* [Manage your preferences and applications](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/#control)
* [Choose strong passwords and verification process](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/#security)
* ]Understand surveillance and encryption](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/privacy-security/#surveillance)

Learn about some key findings about Open Innovation from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“Close to a third of the world’s population still have no data protection rights.“ “Just four in 10 (38%) of internet users trust that their activities on the internet are not being monitored.”

*“There is more public scrutiny of surveillance laws than before, but it hasn’t stopped greater snooping powers from being proposed in Britain, Pakistan, France and several other countries.” 

* **Digital inclusion**

For the Internet to fulfill its greatest promise, it must reflect the diversity and experience of all people, everywhere.

**How to practice inclusion?**

* [Promote diversity in online environments](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/digital-inclusion/#diversity)
* [Practice and model respectful exchanges online](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/digital-inclusion/#respect)
* [Support universal access](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/digital-inclusion/#access)

Some key findings about Digital Inclusion from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“Unless policies change fast, only 16% of people in least developed countries will be online by 2020. 58% of people in the world can't afford an Internet connection. 39.5% of the world’s population cannot afford Internet on their phone or mobile device”

*“Chinese is the second biggest language on the Internet in terms of users, but only 2% of Web content is in Chinese.”

*"73% of Internet users have seen someone harassed online and 40% have personally experienced it." 

* **Decentralization*

Decentralization means the Internet is controlled by many. It’s millions of devices linked together in an open network. No one actor should ever own it, control it, or switch it off to anyone.

**How to promote decentralization?**

* [Speak up for Net Neutrality](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#neutrality)
* [Try using tools that are interoperable](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#interoperability)
* [Be informed about the tools you use online.](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#choice)
* [Contribute new online content](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/decentralization/#local)

Some key findings about Decentralization from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“The Internet and the World Wide Web remain the biggest decentralized communication system humanity has ever seen.”

*“A small handful of companies – including Facebook, Google, Apple, Tencent, AliBaba and Amazon – dominate the global Internet sector. In most EU member countries, Google controls more than 90 percent of the search market. In some countries, it controls as much as 97%”.

*“As of December 2016, 47 countries currently have laws in place to protect Net Neutrality.” 

* **Web literacy**

People everywhere should have the knowledge they need to tap into the full power of the Internet – and use it to make their lives and the world better. This means everyone needs to be able to read, write, and participate online. A healthy Internet is yours to master.

**How to promote Web literacy?**

* [Make online contributions meaningful](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/web-literacy/#meaningful)
* [Teach and mentor others effectively](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/web-literacy/#teaching)
* [Cultivate digital citizenship](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/internet-health/web-literacy/#citizenship)

Some key findings about Web Literacy from the [Report](https://internethealthreport.org/v01/decentralization/):

*“82% of American middle-schoolers assessed couldn’t tell the difference between an ad labeled “sponsored content” and a real news story on a website. “

*“Most people still don’t really understand how the Internet works at a basic level.”

*“A small-scale survey in five countries showed that many Facebook users either don’t know the app is on the Internet, or have no idea there is an Internet beyond Facebook.” 

**Web Literacy Map**

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/4ys8oSn.png)

In 2013, Mozilla, in collaboration with community stakeholders, designed the first [Web Literacy Map](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/) to identify a set of core web literacy skills, and set the stage for engaging individuals as citizens of the web.

To learn more about the competencies and skills included in the most recent version of our Web Literacy map, read this [White paper](http://mozilla.github.io/webmaker-whitepaper/).

## MODULE 2. A NETWORK OF LEADERS

# LESSON 1. What is Mozilla Club?

*"The best demonstrations of technology inspire us, not simply because of what technology can do, but because of what people can do with the know-how to improve their lives and communities". [Sam Dyson, Hive Chicago](http://hivechicago.org/the-web-is-a-human-platform-part-1/)

The Internet is more than computers and code. The Internet is about people. And this is what Mozilla Clubs are all about: interacting with others to share, learn, teach and build upon platforms, to make things that matter. Our Clubs are local, in-person gatherings that focus on making the web relevant to their communities.

> **Outline**

> A. What is Mozilla Clubs?
> B. Mozilla Clubs Model
> C. Clubs share one mission and multiple pathways 


### A. What is Mozilla Clubs

Mozilla Clubs are small communities that meet regularly to help build a Healthy Internet. They empower individuals to be informed contributors of open innovation, online privacy and security, digital inclusion, decentralization, and web literacy. Clubs host events and gatherings where creativity, collaboration, innovation and learning come together with a goal to keep the internet open and accessible to all.

**A Bit of History: From Maker Party to Mozilla Clubs**

[Maker party](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/events) was a community led campaign where artists, educators, activists, coders, and entrepreneurs connected to trade ideas, network, innovate, educate and inspire people to take action towards protecting the Open Internet. 

! [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/hVi7nl6.png)

During the campaign thousands of people participated in one-off events that included participatory activities, presentations, demonstrations and much more.

After the success of Maker Party (over 5000 events in over 100 countries) we [decided to move forward](http://amiradhalla.com/2015/10/08/sustaining-the-movement-from-maker-party-to-mozilla-clubs/) with a strategy to making Web Literacy universal.

The goal of Maker Parties was to light a spark around Web Literacy, and with it’s success we knew we were on to something. We started to think about how we could transform that spark into something that had a long-term impact on learners. That’s when Mozilla Clubs emerged, which allowed individuals to run multiple events over a longer period of time and build upon their learning together. Some of our community was already doing this with Maker Parties, so we were learning from their success.

Mozilla Clubs launched in early 2015, and is still evolving as we learn how multiple languages, locations and cultures affect each individual Club. A big priority for us is to develop it with and for our global community.

In 2015 we had 150+ clubs created in over 90 cities. By 2017 we more than doubled our community with 400+ clubs in over 50 countries. Club captains include classroom teachers, software developers/engineers, college students, community leaders, after school educators and more. Some clubs have direct ties to schools or other local learning institutions. Others take place in informal learning spaces like internet cafes, libraries, community centers and tech hubs.

**A Network of Leaders **
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/QoNm35y.jpg)
[Photo: used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/amirad/34522262790/)

Clubs are key nodes in the Mozilla community, which enables connections to other people with shared interests. By connecting with others, individual Mozilla club nodes have access to best practices and mentorship around the world.

Mozilla Staff, Regional Coordinators, Club captains, facilitators and club members are among this network of leaders. They connect with each other to provide support and together cultivate their work through ongoing and participatory collaboration.

Here is more information on each of those roles:

* **Regional Coordinators** mentor multiple Club Captains in one geographic location to realize their full potential through clear, continued leadership and support. They are nominated and trained by Mozilla staff.

* **Mozilla Clubs staff** empower Regional Coordinators and Club Captains through continued mentorship, clear leadership pathways and open leadership practices.

* **Club members** collaborate with peers in their club to generate valuable contributions to Internet Health. It is important to note that all Clubs must have at least one Club Captain, but do not need to be connected with a Regional Coordinator.

### B. Mozilla Clubs Model 

Mozilla Clubs is a unique and flexible model that increases awareness about Internet Health in local communities. It provides a basic infrastructure with customizable activities, guides, templates and more.

Here are some club examples that can be used as inspiration:

[Mozilla Cagliari Club.](http://mozillacagliariclub.edovio.com/) A project that organizes regular workshops and free events to increase Web literacy at all levels, in Cagliari, Italy.

**These are some tips and suggestions that help clubs succeed:**

* Club Captains should try to recruit peers to help facilitate and organize events/gatherings.
* Identify a space to host club events and gatherings. It can be a library, classroom, coffee shop, internet cafe, community space, a kitchen table, etc. Make sure the space is clean, accessible, safe and welcoming for your club members.
* Prepare a plan in advance of every club event or gathering. Content may be drawn from the Internet Health Report, Web Literacy map, Learning curriculum, Activate page, Network website or anything else related to internet health.
* Decide how Frequently the club will meet. This can be weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. Some meetings can happen virtually, but it is most beneficial for club participants to meet in person.
* Recruit a diverse group of members to participate in your club. If a club has specific goals around gender inclusion, creating a safe space and/or age be intentional about how you recruit for the club.
* Review the communication and branding guide and other guides for more tips on getting started with your club.

### C. Clubs share one mission and multiple pathways

Mozilla Clubs share Mozilla’s mission to “Protect the Open Web” and have the flexibility to follow different pathways in doing so. From advocacy campaigns to web literacy, club leaders inspire and engage people from their communities, fueling the movement in their various cultures and locals.

They incorporate internet health issues like Privacy & Security, Open Innovation, Decentralization, Digital Inclusion and Web Literacy through a variety of activities such as:

* Speaking at public events
* Advocating on social media
* Facilitating workshops
* Organizing convenings
* Leading study groups
* Moderating discussions
* Participating online (Mozilla-related forums, mailing lists, wikis, websites, chat channels)

### A. What is a Club Captain?
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/Pu0fH1V.jpg)
Photo used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla.

Club Captain roles and responsibilities may vary in each club depending on it’s size and if there are any volunteers helping. Sometimes Captains act as facilitators, who are directly leading activities and events. Sometimes they organize and leave the facilitation to others. Either way they play a very important part in reaching the goals of the Club. We recommend that all Club Captains ensure that

* Participants are learning about Internet Health using inclusive and participatory methods.
* Participants are being empowered through engaging activities, peer learning and meaningful conversations through open practices.
* They regularly share their experience and learning with the larger Mozilla Network.

### B. Challenges and solutions Club Captains encounter 

* **Defining an identity.** This is key to promote your club, attract participants and recruit volunteers. Creating a unique identity will help you to build credibility in case you plan to fundraise for it. Read this [Mozilla Clubs Comms Guidelines and Templates](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/comms_template/).

* **Finding a venue.** The place where your Club is going to take place is important. In the quest to find the perfect space, you may want to reach out to organizations such as libraries, coffee shops, schools, universities, community associations, etc. Once you find an adequate space you can:

* **Inquire with someone at the organization.** Set an appointment to present your Club and what you'd like to do in the space.

* **Prepare an agenda.** Organize a presentation about your Club, including the goals, audience, session's frequency, and possible benefits to the organization. Also, prepare questions about access, security, connectivity and available computers as is dictated by your Club's needs.

* **Finding and recruiting volunteers and members.**

- Make a list of potential members/facilitators. Start with your closest groups: friends, family, classmates, etc. and  those within your network who will find value in participating in the club.
- Search on the web. Look for open communities of practice with shared interests in Internet Health and join their social media channels, and events, if possible.
- Attend tech or education fairs and festivals. In these spaces you can meet people with common backgrounds and projects. Talk to them about your Club and discuss ways to connect.
- Find projects that serve a need in your community. Think of ways your Mozilla Club can contribute. This will attract new people interested in supporting the initiative.
- Organize a session. Once you have found potential attendees, invite them to an event and brainstorm Club goals together!

Take a look at this creative expectation campaign from the Philippines Community to invite volunteers:

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/H7BbPwe.png)

* **Designing a plan.** Think about your participants backgrounds, interests and needs, the resources available (venue, connectivity and equipment), and coincidental schedules for all the actors involved. With that in mind write down a plan. Consider frequency of sessions, goals, and activities. Read this post about how Rio Mozilla Club plans their year. Also, check out this [Leao Mozilla Clubs mind map](https://www.mindmeister.com/628805014/le-o-mozilla-clubs-2016) about how they prepared for their year.

* **Hold regular, face-to-face sessions.** Once you have established a venue, members, volunteers and a learning plan, get started! Make sure to keep your members motivated and engaged. Read and share [facilitation Tips](http://mozilla.github.io/participation-curriculum/facilitation-tips/index.html#introduction with participants and volunteers.

* **Sharing with the world.** Keep posting about your experiences, events, volunteers, accomplishments and lessons learned. Read these guides about [Public Relations](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/marketing-your-mozilla-club-pr-guide/) and [Social Media for marketing](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/marketing-your-mozilla-club-social-media/) your Mozilla Club. Share event recaps on our [event reporter](http://mozilla.github.io/clubs-events/), [telegram](https://telegram.me/joinchat/BwUk1goEpt1QuBxsV_PyZQ), [discourse](https://forum.learning.mozilla.org/c/mozilla-clubs) and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mozillaclubs/). 

### C. Support Club Captains get through the network

Mozilla Club staff support Club Captains with

* An active community of other Club Captains.
* An online training platform.
* Curriculum that’s free, open and educator-tested.
* Guides and other useful resources.

## MODULE 3. BEST PRACTICES FOR RUNNING LOCAL EVENTS

# LESSON 1. The impact of participant- centered activities
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/B44HZYp.jpg)

At Mozilla, we encourage club leaders to curate curriculum, activities and gatherings according to people’s needs and wants. They should welcome all questions, encourage risk-taking, and understand the value of mistakes and failures as powerful learning moments. 

> **Outline**

> A. What does "participant centered" mean?
> B. Key ideas from the participant-centered approach applied to Mozilla Clubs
> C. Examples on the participant-centered approach

### A. What does "participant centered" mean?

The participant-centered approach shifts the focus from the leader to the participant, in a quest to develop their autonomy and independence. It is based on the [constructivist](http://www.learning-theories.com/constructivism.html) theory that emphasizes the interlocutor critical role in constructing meaning from new information and prior experience. 

### B. Key ideas from the participant-centered approach applied to Mozilla Clubs

Here are tips on how to use the participant-centered approach when facilitating a Club event:

* **Act as a coach, not an instructor.** Your mission as a facilitator in a Mozilla Club event is to motivate, engage and help learners to connect their interests with opportunities in the digital world. Your role should be seen as a coach rather than an instructor. Instead of providing a lecture, you will share your knowledge in a way that inspires others to create, make, hack and tweak.

* **Get to know your audience.** This is a MUST for you as a Club Leader. Whether you are speaking in a public event, or leading a workshop, your understanding of their particular talents, interests and abilities will help you to gain participants’ full engagement.

* **Encourage peer-to-peer interaction and collaborative thinking.** The activities designed at Mozilla often embed constructive conversations among participants, as well as interaction and knowledge sharing. Your challenge as a leader is to trigger club member's contribution during the activity.

* **Let participants choose what they are going to work on, based on their interests.** A powerful way to connect with club members is to organize brainstorm activities about projects, challenges and interests. Once you know what motivates them draw a plan to connect those interests with the web tools and digital skills you master.

* **Design the physical space and consider time to improve the experience.** The disposition of the space influences human behavior. If your venue is organized in a traditional way, with hierarchies and individual desks, your participants might feel inhibited to interact and share. 

### C. Examples on the participant-centered approach

**1: Using interactivity in public speaking**

Read [this article](https://blog.sli.do/seven-creative-ideas-for-interactive-conference-sessions/) to find some inspiration and learn about strategies to implement interactivity, and move from being a Lecturer to performing as a coach, engaging your audience and making of a public speaking session a remarkable experience.

**2: A day in a participant-centered classroom**

In [this blog post](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/connected-classroom-information-literacy), Andrew Marcinek shares a reflection about a day in his classroom. Read about his attempts to find new ways to connect students, give them more autonomy and remove himself as the focus of the stage.

**3: A Reader-Centered Approach to Social Media Writing**

In [this article](http://blog.bettercom.com/business-writing-advice/bid/84895/A-reader-centered-approach-to-social-media-writing) you will learn how to engage your readers by considering your readers needs, in order to attract their attention, help them understand your material, and ensure that their time is valued. 

# LESSON 2. How to plan for fun and engaging events
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/cBDWFws.jpg)

Mozilla Clubs are open, playful, and fun for those attending and facilitating. In addition to teaching and learning, Club leaders are empowering people to excel in their area of inquiry and expertise.

>Outline

> A. Why fun is an important element for a Club?
> B. Key ideas on how to incorporate fun and exploration into Mozilla Clubs.
> C. Examples of fun & explorative approaches.

### A. Why fun is an important element for a Club?

*“[...] [research](https://sanwen8.cn/p/43eZlND.html) has repeatedly shown that the benefits associated with play are profound and wide-ranging. Following a meta-analysis of 800 studies, […] there was cogent evidence for the positive impact of play on developmental outcomes. Play was found to significantly promote cognitive and social aspects of development."*

In Mozilla Clubs, we understand that playfulness goes beyond the concept of "entertainment", and takes advantage of this special human capacity to explore and understand the world through "playing". It recognizes that we are not only Homo Sapiens, but also Homo Ludens "Man the Player".

[“Games are an integral part of all cultures and are one of the oldest forms of human social interaction, from the ancient Greek Olympics to current computer games. Throughout history, games have a big impact on how we leverage strategy, rules and many life activities.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_games)

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/YCp0cQP.jpg)
["Evolution", Image by Divianarts](http://www.divianarts.com/59192)

While the game tends to disappear in most of adult mammals, it persists and even evolves in the human adult world according to multiple modes, and is supported by specific institutions. 

### B. Key ideas on how to incorporate fun and exploration into Mozilla Clubs

* Incorporate humor as an engagement strategy. Explore simple humor techniques to help maintain a joyful experience.

* If your club focuses on Web Literacy, search for fun teaching activities. Explore Mozilla teaching activities which are strategically designed to be engaging and fun when teaching how to read, write and participate on the web. These activities have been tested in schools, after school programs, libraries and community centers around the globe.

* Explore existing games or [create your](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/a-beginners-guide-to-game-makery) own to assure a fun and engaging experiences.

* Use [icebreakers](http://www.icebreakers.ws/) and micro-activities. Many experienced Club leaders talk about including these in their sessions as an effective way to help people get to know each other.

Keep participants on their feet and moving. Mind and body are connected, which is why performing activities that involve motion will help release students from a passive posture and engage them physically and energetically. Try activities like [Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves](https://michelle.makes.org/thimble/MTU0MjcxNzQ0MA==/ali-baba-and-the-40-thieves), or [How to Hack the Robot Dance](https://mozteach.makes.org/thimble/how-to-hack-the-robot-dance).

### C. Examples on the Fun & Exploratory approach 

[1: Comics for Social Change](http://www.ucdvo.org/t4cms/Comics-for-Social-Change.pdf)

Learn from the experience of Grassroots Comics, and organization which uses illustration to introduce important messages on social justice. They are drawn by individuals and community groups.

[2: “Open world, open web” using games for learning](https://learning.mozilla.org/blog/open-world-open-web)

Mozilla participated in a gaming session for a Hackathon in Charlottesville, VA in which participants formed teams to tackle real-world problems. Chad Sansing, Curriculum Developer at Mozilla, and facilitator of this session said, "The prototypes our groups presented delivered everything I hoped for from the event. With minimal big picture coaching on the Open Web and targeted technical help from a few mentors, our teams captured their ideas about online freedom, openness, and privacy. At the end the consensus among the judges seemed to be that the quality of work produced by attendees rivaled that of undergraduate students working in areas like computer science and biomedical engineering".

# LESSON 3. Designing hands on activities

![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/tYDt5FW.jpg)
[Photo: Flickr used under CC-BY-SA by Mozilla.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mozilladrumbeat/)

Mozilla Clubs promote experiences that are goal-oriented, hands-on, and designed to support work that further open source projects and research. 

> Outline

> A. What is a hands-on approach?
> B. Key ideas about hands-on practices.
> C. Examples of hands-on activities

### A. What is learning by making? (25 min)

Humans have a history of making. We cook, sew, build, write, play music, paint, tell stories, etc. In many ways making is how we learn about our environment and create solutions for challenges we face in everyday life. It is also one of the many ways we express ourselves. By continuously sharing what we make with others we get feedback on how to improve our ideas. Throughout the making process, we learn, connect with people, and shape our reality. And gain new skills in the process.

**Is this approach all about MAKING STUFF?**

In this [video](https://vimeo.com/136525046), the Agency by Design (AbD), explains how the maker empowerment concept is not just about people simply making things, but rather they are empowered to see the world and its systems as things that have been designed. Therefore, they understand that these designs can be tweaked, hacked, re-envisioned, etc. The intention of the making approach is that learners can come to feel empowered, and have a sense of agency over the things in their world.

### B. Key ideas about "Hands-on" practices

From activism campaigns to Web Literacy sessions, hands-on activities will help your participants to be more focused and engaged. It also unlocks different ways of participation for all types of personalities (introverted and extroverted).

These are some recommendations for you to follow if you’re planning to have some makey makey activities in your events:

* Create a repository of makey activities. It is always good to have a large bank of resources to consult for your Club. Where can you find them? Explore [Mozilla Teaching Activities](https://teach.mozilla.org/activities), design your customized activities, or do your own research on the web; there are tons of open activities that other educators have successfully tried. Take a look of [Codedojo](http://kata.coderdojo.com/wiki/Learning_Resource), [Code.org](https://code.org/educate), [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com/us/how-to), and [Made with Code](https://www.madewithcode.com/).

* Incentivize the maker mind. By thinking critically about the daily-life objects that surround us, you can learn from them. Bring an object to a session and ask your participants to wonder and brainstorm about its design and functionality. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cI2cMyOZVgE) to see some samples.

* Select projects to address community challenges . Design projects for your club in which participants can learn new tools, improve digital skills, do local community research, and design creative solutions to address specific problems. Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMCZvGesRz8) that illustrates how to address daily life problems using PBL.

* Plan for mistakes. In our everyday life, we learn from our mistakes. We can simulate this in structured experiences by offering context-sensitive feedback during games, reviews and tests.

* Facilitate exploration. Provide resources, references, videos and podcasts for personal exploration. Exploration provides an opportunity to construct knowledge in a way that is meaningful for each learner.

# LESSON 4. How to be Participatory & Inclusive
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/p2zhxLY.jpg)
[Photo by Rio Mozilla Club used under CC BY by Mozilla Clubs](http://riomozillaclub.org/)

In Mozilla Clubs, we're thoughtful about our community members and respectful of differences. We aim to understand each other's motivations, needs, and challenges in order to create experiences that work well for everyone.

> Outline

> A. What do we understand about inclusive environments?
> B. Rethinking inclusion
> C. Teachable experience

### A. What are inclusive environments?

Social scientists use the term “inclusion” to describe environments where individuals, regardless of demographics, backgrounds or experiences feel valued, respected, and have the possibility to reach their full potential. In short, inclusive environments are those in which people feel accepted and have equal access to opportunities. 

In [this video](https://youtu.be/zdV8OpXhl2g), Helen Turnbull, an inclusion expert, explains how our "blind spots" can drive us–even if we're well-intentioned–to perform exclusionary practices based on affinity biases.

This perspective helps us address the challenge of inclusion from a more comprehensive perspective, and allows us to design more effective strategies.

** More resources about unconscious bias:**

* A report that describes unconscious bias from the perspective of Asap SCIENCE.
* A set of videos shared by Facebook on how to recognize our biases so we can reduce their negative effects in the workplace
* A video about a growing body of research around unconscious bias, led by scientists at Google Work.

** Rethinking inclusion**

As club leaders we must learn to give every participant equal opportunities to reach their full potential. In [this video](https://youtu.be/SS7ID8VClko), Quinetta Roberson brings a new perspective to address inclusion by focusing on the contribution that each human being can make from his or her own skills, background, and knowledge. 

An approach like this suggests that inclusion becomes real when all the members of your class, club, community, find a way to participate and contribute. Club Leaders should do their best todesign effective mechanisms to guarantee participation. If we think of ways to enable every learner to contribute, the larger community will benefit. 

Also see these guides about diversity and inclusion:

* [Learn how to create safe and convenient learning spaces for women and girls](http://mozilla.github.io/learning-networks/clubs/events-women-girls-guide/#introduction)
* [Explore some Inclusive Teaching Strategies to address gender, disabilities, violence issues](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu//cft/guides-sub-pages/diversity/)

### B. Key ideas to make your Mozilla Club inclusive and participatory

Cultivate inclusion self-awareness. Try to understand your own weaknesses and strengths in order to become more aware of inclusion risks and opportunities:

* Recognize any hot buttons/biases or stereotypes you may have. Learn how to identify them by completing the activity at the end of the lesson.
* Be sensitive to terminology that refers to specific ethnic and cultural groups.
* Become more informed about the history and culture of people in your club.
* Select websites and articles whose language is gender-neutral and free of stereotypes.
* Get to know each student. Learn their names and how to pronounce them correctly.
* Make it safe for everyone to voice their views by accepting all views and perspectives
* Present different sides of an issue.
* Be prepared to deal with conflicts of opinion or interest.

- Read [this article](http://bokcenter.harvard.edu/managing-hot-moments-classroom) on how to handle difficult situations in a learning setting.

### C. Examples of Participatory and Inclusive environments

1: [We’re on a Mission to Make Rwanda Web Literate](https://medium.com/read-write-participate/were-on-a-mission-to-make-rwanda-web-literate-a6fcb11f5610)

This Blog Post describes the experience of Mozilla working with allies on the Digital Ambassadors Program, to train and equip thousands of youth leaders with the skills and knowledge to teach web literacy in low-resourced areas across the country.

2: [Finland's Education System](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/why-are-finlands-schools-successful-49859555/)

Only three decades ago, Finland found itself struggling with an educational system that was facing difficulty. Now, it is an education superpower, valuing inclusion and equality more than excellence. Educators are focused on developing individual's gifts, interests, passions, and goals and connecting them with real life challenges.VIDEO

**Some of their principles:**

**1. Equality.** There are no elite schools. Each school has absolutely the same equipment, features and proportional financing. Intensive studying of certain subjects is not welcome. It is not believed that mathematics is more important than, for example, art. There are no “bad” and “good” pupils. Comparison of pupils with others is prohibited.

**2. Individuality.** For each child, an individual plan of training is developed.

**3. Practicality.** Finns say: “Either we prepare children for life, or for the exams. We choose the first.” Therefore examinations in Finnish schools don’t exist. There is only one mandatory standard test at the end of secondary school.

**4. Independence.** The Finns believe that schools should teach a child to get ready for an independent, successful life. Therefore, they are taught to think and acquire knowledge on their own.
