# Digital Ambassador Program
In 2017 we partnered DOT to aid the government of Rwanda on a plan to make Rwanda web literate. 
The program, called the Digital Ambassadors Program, requires us to train and equip thousands of youth leaders 
with the skills and knowledge to teach web literacy in low-resourced areas across the country. 
Over 5 years, the ambassadors will reach millions of individuals who are (or will be) coming online for the first time.

DOT and Mozilla are committed to:
* Training Digital Ambassadors so they can execute the work on the ground
* Creating and supporting curriculum that is to be used by ambassadors when teaching
* Developing Mozilla Clubs in the areas where local individuals can continuously attend and learn

To succeed we need to ensure that:

* Ambassadors know how to teach basic web literacy. 
They are able to teach how to use the Internet, apps and resources to first time learners. 
To people who might not know what the web is or are scared to use it. As well as how to remain protected once they are online.
* Ambassadors are well equipped to facilitate this learning in low-resources areas. 
Most of the areas they will be working in have limited bandwidth, few resources and access will likely be only through mobile phones.
* Ambassadors are able to show individuals how the Internet is relevant to them and the opportunities it provides. 
This means making the Internet relevant to individuals and their everyday task — how can something like the 
Internet be used to make them better shopkeepers or access resource from the government.

In March, 2017 we conducted a two day training in Kigali for 30 Digital Ambassadors. 
The [agenda](https://thimbleprojects.org/juliavallera/281859/#overview) included offline and online activities that 
demonstrates opportunities web literacy provides and how to facilitate this learning in low-resource areas.
The group of participants in this training are doing the same training for 25 of their peers. 
Replicating the training will give them a chance to dive into the material even more and tweak it to fit their needs and 
their communities needs.
