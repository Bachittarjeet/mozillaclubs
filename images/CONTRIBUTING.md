You are very welcome to add new images to this folder.

# How to do it?

### 1. Adding a new image via drag & drop!

Just go to the file on your computer, drag it and drop it inside the Images folder. A pull request 
will be sent to the Repo managers, who will be in charge to "approve" what you have sent. This process may take some minutes untill
you can see your images uploaded in the folder.

### 2. Adding a gallery inside a md file

To display an image in a md, use the following markdown syntax...

![image alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg "Image Title Text")
