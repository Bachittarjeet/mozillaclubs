## About Mozilla Clubs  

A Mozilla Club brings people together locally to explore, participate in and create the open web in an engaging and collaborative way. They are groups that meet regularly and host events or meet-ups where creativity, collaboration, teaching and learning come together with one objective: developing digital skills.

There are currently 400+ registered Clubs that span 50+ countries. [Mozilla Clubs](http://learning.mozilla.org/) Captains have the opportunity to join several digital channels that help them connect to each other and share experiences. 

## Connect with Mozilla Clubs 

Mozilla Clubs also has a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/mozillaclubs/) with 1000+ participants, a [learning forum](https://forum.learning.mozilla.org/c/mozilla-clubs) with 80+ topic threads, a monthly Club Leaders Call with featured guests and an [event gallery](http://mozilla.github.io/clubs-events/).
